Tokens are special types to describe the input of the user
First step is to break down the input into smaller tokens
create a current token and a linked list of tokens
iterate through the input character by character and handle the combinations of the characters
add the characters to the current token while iterating
how to handle:
spaces: if the character is a space add the token to the list and reset current token
special characters: (>, <, >>, <<, $, |) add the current token, create another token and add the special character, reset the tokens
other characters: just add to the current token

During execution there will be a priority on which command starts first:
1. $ always first
2. >, <, >>, << redirections go second
3. everything else
