Parsing:
do the single quotes parsing similiar to double quotes
clean up the double quotes parsing and the parsing.c file

this thing also:
//bash-3.2$ ec""""ho hel"a"lo
//helalo

set_types:
dollar sign and declaration, as well as the quotes and quoted files etc.

Double quotes:
double quotes and single quotes work in a way where its " open the " close, and concats everything next to
it if its not considered a special character.
ex: ec"h"o

double quotes semi works, some cases dont work like:
"e" """c" "h o" hello
e-- h--o hello
i believe the problem is the "" quotes then " after it.
but for simpler cases it should work i think.

i think parsing for the double quotes is done, single quotes next, then add functions to set types while parsing
for some of the cases.

Piping works more or less for standard fds
	- need to address user files
	- MUST ADDRESS LEAKS!!!
	- Clean up code for Norminette

to implement $ and = we will need to create our env. First get the values of envp and make it into a linked list,
Then when using execve we will use our own env, if changes need to be made to our environment then we change them while adding.
When we add a value like a=2, we will add this using ft_lstadd_back. the struct t_env will have a key and value
A=2
key: A
value: 2

When looping through "", if we find a $, we expand it there, then continue parsing.
if looping through '' we dont expand it.

HEREDOC test fd_in and fd_out. Norminette and leaks ;(
