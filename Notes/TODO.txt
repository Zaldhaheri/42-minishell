Parsing:
do the single quotes parsing similiar to double quotes
clean up the double quotes parsing and the parsing.c file

this thing also:
//bash-3.2$ ec""""ho hel"a"lo
//helalo

set_types:
dollar sign and declaration, as well as the quotes and quoted files etc.

Double quotes:
double quotes and single quotes work in a way where its " open the " close, and concats everything next to
it if its not considered a special character.
ex: ec"h"o

double quotes semi works, some cases dont work like:
"e" """c" "h o" hello
e-- h--o hello
i believe the problem is the "" quotes then " after it.
but for simpler cases it should work i think.
