parsing idea:
while(str[i] isnt null)
{
    r = ft_strcpy(r + 1, str[i]); //append last character to r
    if (checkimportant(r)) //function returns value 1 if found, 0 if not found. ex: r = ls, returns 1
    {
        reset r;
    }
    i++;
}

another idea:
maybe take in the first character of the input then, from that we look at other possibilities.
example input echo hello world

read first character
checker = "e";
go to another function check other combination or commands that start with e
e->cho
e->nv
e->xit

check the next characters in another function, else continue and add another character
this might make the searching much more faster and efficient
